# Frequency Analysis of a Wave File Code


This code needs a wave file, which should be typed in the FILENAME variable on line 5.

When you run the code, the pitch at various points in time will be printed on screen and a graph of the Frequency domain, at every window will be displayed. If you dont want the frequency domain being diplayed for every window, you can comment line 298 out. After the code finishes, a final graph will be displayed with frequency as the y axis and time as the x axis.

#Necessary Instillations

You have to install numPy and matplotlib in order to run this code.

#What the code does

Reads a wave file and outputs the pitch and frequency of the wave file at each point in time. Also can gives a graph of the frequency domain for every every b;ock of time that is analyzed.
